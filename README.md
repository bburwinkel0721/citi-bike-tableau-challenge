# citi-bike-tableau-challenge
## General Overview
- Aggregated the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs in 2016 and explored two unexpected phenomena.
    - Gender Connections with Bike Useage
    - Popularity Connections with the Citi Bike Network
## Tasks
- Designed approximately 5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (approximately 10 total visuals).
- Designed a dashboard for each phenomenon.
- Created one map for city officials.
- Created a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
- Explored the following questions:
    - What is the most popular stations to start from and end at?
    - Who is the most common city bike user?
    - What are the peak hours of use during a given day?
    - What are the peak days of use during the week?
    - What are the peak months of you string the year?
    - What is the most popular route?

## Brief Analysis of Tableau Workbook
- For the Gender Dashboard:
    - As we begin the analysis, we can see in the upper left-hand corner, the monthly trends for individuals who have identified as either male or female. We can see that both seem to follow very similar patterns as we progress through the year, but we can see that there is a much larger user base amongst the male population. 
    - In the top right hand corner, we can see which days of the week both males and females tend to favor. For the male users, we can see that the weekdays tend to be more popular, which is also true for the females. 
    - In the bottom left-hand corner, we can see the more popular roots and the distributions between male and females. We can see Pershing Square North tends to pop up in many of these routes and many are more heavily dominated by male users, comparatively to female users. 
    - Finally, in the bottom right hand corner, we can see an age breakdown for male and female users. We can see that the most active age group tends to be individuals in their 30s.
- For the Popularity Dashboard:
    - The first immediate trend we can see from the upper left-hand corner is that the amount of time spent riding escalates throughout the year until it peaks during the summer months and then begins to decline back down during a winter time. 
    - From the top right hand corner we can see that, people tend to use the bikes during the early morning hours (approximately 8 AM) and late afternoon hours (approximately 5 PM) which seems to align with when people tend to go to and come from work. 
    - The bottom left hand corner we can see some of the more popular stations to start at and end at, with Pershing Square North being the most popular station overall. 
    - Finally, we can examine which stations tend to see the most traffic and their geographical location at any given month during the year. Based off of the map, it appears as if many of the more popular stations tend to be more centralized within the city bike network.
